TACTICS
Pretend Conversations (to one another, over the phone, to self)
	REFLECTION: I can't remember the original Chinese text, but it's something like 
	"Discuss the bush while pointing at the tree."

	jUMBLE: Combining elements from several areas or time periods of a target's life
	creating a scrambled narrative

Tableuxs

	CAPTIVE AUDIENCE: Events rather then encounters. Think live-theater without interactivity,
	but an unmistakable feeling of the personalizing/tailoring of the message.

cutting the corners (slowly isolating target from support)

From written notes October 19, 2018

slowly depleting resources (taking, stealing, asking, ripping off)
	dismissive; promises/ lies --while at the same time walking away
	[aka 'empty calories'] - 	the promise is always there but no delivery
								the possibility without the promise
								when the failure occurs there is no apology or regret
	also, rude, crass boorish

the thing is somem events and information are signficant, but some are meaningless or intentionally misleading --adding to the madness.
