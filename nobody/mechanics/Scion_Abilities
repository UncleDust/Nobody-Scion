Scion Abilities

Control of Media - The ability to shape society and control the mob mentality via the media. Not only does the Scion have the ability to control mainstream media, he also eventually gains the ability to control social media, comment sections, and popular online sources of information. 

Creation of Demonstrations - The cash to hire people that can stage and act out any sort of public theater that is called for; shootings, bombings, bomb hoaxes (hoaxes of any sort, really), fights, public protests, displays of public support, popular movements...anything. 

Control of Government Institutions: The scion has the connections to influence any and all government institutions. This includes the obvious like the police, court systems, and intelligence agencies, but it also includes, schools, libraries, parks, and ride share programs.

SUPERMUNDANE

The ability to read minds - This seems to have a distance limit and he only seems to notice things that the Nobody notices himself. The stronger the thought and/or associated emotion the liklier it is that the Scion will detect it. The Nobody can counter this to a certain extent, but not completely.
