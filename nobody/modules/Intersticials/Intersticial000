PROLOGUE

	He shook his head and stars fell from his antlers. One of his
legs extended and bent at the knee, the other leg curled underneath
himself, supporting him; one arm with its elbow locked and supporting
him, the other resting atop his knee. 
	He stared through green clouds, impossibly shifting lines, swirls 
of moving light. 

	He was serene, composed, and eternal. 

	His opposite sat (fitingly) across from him. His shimmering throne
supporting his gargantuan frame. His skin red and glistening with nebulas
and galaxies. He pulled on his pipe. Its cherry glowing; shades of purple
and burgundies as he drank from his cup their shared realm filled with 
music that to our mortal and human ears would seem like the crash of ocean
waves, the paper wingbeats of birds, the echoing laughter of a stadium of
children. 

	"Shall we play another?" the latter asked the former. "You almost 
won the last one didn't you?" the former replied in calm repose. "Hmph."

gross the preliminary playthings of the two God_Monsters.

K'bah-lin; The Antlered
K'bah-lin; the One that Moves in Radiant Splendour Between Spaces and is
Beyond Time. 
K'bah-lin; The Great Architect, Builder, and Master Technician moved first. 

He created innumerable helper-agents; each a node, each an object, each one 
his tool & instrument and with a flourish assigned them. 

Vlankoor Tuh hHat; He That Laughs Alone in the Darkness
Vlankoor Tuh hHat; The Fractured, The Hobbled, The Hairy
Vlankoor Tuh hHat; The Red One responded. He did he create a large pile 
of his own. He divided this pile into many smaller piles at regular
intervals on his side. The he walked along, kicking each of them
across the Game in large, arcing, billows of Dust.
